title: Learn about the trees of Copenhagen
---
This webpage is built as a part of the course Social Data Analysis and Visualization at DTU during the spring semester of 2020. For more information on the work behind the webpage go to the ‘About’ page. The authors of the page are Andreas Kaae, Jesper Dybkjær and Kristian Nissen Breddam. 


Have you ever walked the streets of Copenhagen and looked up at all the trees and thought to yourself “Wow, this is so interesting!”? If not, then you are just like most of us. Many people like the trees in Copenhagen and  enjoy them without ever really given them any thoughts. That is why we wanted to take a seemingly boring dataset about the Trees of Copenhagen municipality and turn it into something interesting and maybe even useful!
The trees you will see on this page are only the trees which are on communal roads in the municipality of Copenhagen (which does not include Frederiksberg). This means that the trees in some of the parks such as ‘Kalvebod fælled’, ‘Botanisk Have’ and ‘Kongens Have’ are not included, so when looking at results and conclusions remember to take this into account! Most of the graphs on the page are interactive, so we strongly encourage you to interact with the visualizations to explore the trees of Copenhagen as you like!

To begin with the map below illustrates the 10 districts of Copenhagen municipality color coded by the amount of trees

{% include MapNeighbourhoodsOnly.html %}

**Insight:** *The map shows that the district with the most amount of trees are Østerbro and Bispebjerg. To get more information about a specific neighborhood hold the cursor over a district or check out the next graph.*

The question is now which district in Copenhagen you want to live in if you prefer green surroundings and trees? See the visualization below and use your cursor to gain the full insight.

{% include bar2-3.html %}
**Insight:** *If you are the kind of person who prefer to have the trees all by yourself the graph below to the left shows that the best place to live is Bispebjerg. Bispebjerg has double the amount of trees per 100 citizens than Nørrebro. If you on the other hand are the kind of person who really likes to have many trees close to you then the graph to the right might help you. It reveals that Nørrebro by far is the best place to live. If you are more the kind of person who cares but about getting value for your money then the graph at the bottom reveals your answer. It shows that the place where you get the most trees for your buck (trees per 1000 DKK square meter price) is once again Bispebjerg.*


A district like Østerbro which has a large overall proportion of the trees is interestingly not that desirable, according to the measures above, with regard to trees due to its relatively large area, high population and expensive prices. However, Østerbro has come a long way within the last 10 years. See the graph below. 

{% include bar3PlantedYear.html %}

**Insight:** *The graph above shows that more than 3.000 trees have been planted in Østerbro from 2010 to 2020. The increase is almost more than double the amount than in Valby which is the second most invested district and ten times as many trees as in Brønshøj-Husum at last.The reason can be due to the rapid development projects of streets and areas around Østerbro as well as an increased awareness of the benefits that trees contribute to neighborhoods and its citizens. Especially the areas a bit north of Fælledparken namely Tåsing plads and Sankt Kjelds Plads have been developed. Interact with the maps on the next page and see it yourself.*
