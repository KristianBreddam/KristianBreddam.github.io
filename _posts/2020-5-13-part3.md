title: Part 3, Explore the trees of Copenhagen
---

With this newly generated interest for trees, we hope that you will use this information on your next stroll around in Copenhagen to explore trees that you may never have recognised before. 

Below is a list of great, interesting and maybe surprising targets for your next citywalk. 

* Visit the oldest trees of Copenhagen.
* Notice the donations of private citizens and associations.
* See the most isolated tree in Copenhagen.
* Which trees in your neighbourhood are deemed iconic by the City of Copenhagen? - See [This article](https://www.magasinetkbh.dk/foto/ikoniske-traeer)


**The trees that are older than USA.**

Even though Copenhagen is a city that is under constant development, some trees have managed to stay healthy and are still with us today. You can visit trees that were planted while USA was still under the British rule. These are trees that have experienced the growth of Copenhagen in more than 200 years. Go explore them yourself by inspecting this map below and plan your next city walk.

**The outlier**

What can be seen above are that most trees are planted in groups with few standing far from others. But some trees are planted on their own. Use the map below to spot the trees that are the most alone.

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">*One is standing near the border to another municipality so we believe that it might not be the most isolated. Therefore we have also plotted the second most isolated tree. Go investigate wether our assumption is correct*</span>

**The donated trees**

Why is there so many trees in Copenhagen? Most of them are planted and managed by the TMF (Teknisk miljø forvaltning) within the municipality of Copenhagen. However a few street trees are donated to the city of Copenhagen. Go out and explore what trees are donated nearby you and by whom they have been donated.

**The iconic trees**

The city of Copenhagen have regocnized some trees as iconic. These are chosen as they have a special historic meaning or are special to the local area. These have been found based on the following 7 criteria where they have to fulfill atleast 4 of them: ¨
* The tree must be fully grown.
* There must be a special local affinity to the tree.
* The tree must have a special architectual/spacious value. 
* The tree must have a special biological value.
* The tree must have an active role in the local micro climate. 
* The tree provides special sensory experiences
* The tree has a special historical meaning
