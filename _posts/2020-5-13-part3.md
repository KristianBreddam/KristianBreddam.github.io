title: Part 3, Explore the trees of Copenhagen
---

Below is a list of great, interesting and maybe surprising targets that you could explore in the visualizations on this page and/or on a walk off the city.
* Find the oldest trees of Copenhagen.
* Notice the donated trees from private citizens and associations.
* See the most lonely tree in Copenhagen.
* Discover the trees in your neighbourhood which are deemed iconic by the City of Copenhagen.

**The oldest trees**

Even though Copenhagen is a city that is under constant development, some trees have managed to stay healthy and are still with us today. You can visit trees that were planted while USA was still under the British rule. These are trees that have experienced the growth of Copenhagen in more than 200 years. Go explore them yourself by inspecting this map below and plan your next city walk.

**The loneliest trees**

What can be seen below are that most trees are planted in groups with few standing far from others. However some trees are planted on their own. Use the map below to see the trees that are farthest from their nearest neighbours.  
{% include LonliestTree.html %}
<span style="font-size:0.9em;">*The red circle indicates the most lonely tree in the municipality. It is standing near the border to another municipality so we believe that it might not be the most lonely tree. Therefore we have also plotted the second loneliest tree. Their nearest neighbour is indicated in orange. Go investigate whether our assumption is correct and give the trees some company*</span>

**The donated trees**

Most trees are planted and managed by the TMF (Teknisk miljø forvaltning) within the municipality of Copenhagen. However a few trees are donated to the city of Copenhagen. Explore what trees are donated and by whom they have been donated.
