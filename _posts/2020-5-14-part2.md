title: Part 2, See the trees of Copenhagen 
---
Copenhagen is blessed with a large variety of tree types throughout the city which the map below illustrates. 
All registered trees of Copenhagen have been plotted and color coded accordingly to the tree family. 

**By clicking on the tree family** the trees will appear and disappear from the map allowing you to explore your favorite tree types and easily see the distribution across Copenhagen. 

The **toolbar** below the map further allows you to zoom in on the map to explore the trees of your neighborhood and reveals details about each tree.

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">**Insight:** *Notice that alot of the dots are green, these are all the ‘Not registered’ trees meaning that their tree family is unknown. The map also shows large clusters of trees as some parks are included.*

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
*The map elegantly illustrates how similar tree types are often planted along roads, as rows of same colored dots are seen throughout the map such as the Linden trees along Øster Allé (Østerbro) next to Parken.*</span>


In a diverse city like Copenhagen biodiversity among the trees is important not only because it is nice to look at different tree types but also because biodiversity helps prevent tree diseases. 

If a neighbourhood has a high concentration of certain tree types this area is more prone to losing a large proportion of its trees if a disease were to break out. 

Inspect the map below and find out how diverse each neighbourhood is and how the trees look.

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">**Insight:** *Notice that many trees in all neighbourhoods are marked as ‘Not registered’ (green). When not considering the ´Not registered´ trees it appears that an area like Amager Øst is better prepared for a disease outbreak than Indre By as the distribution of the trees are more uniform. Indre By would lose 26.6% of its trees if a disease among Linden trees were to happen.*</span>
